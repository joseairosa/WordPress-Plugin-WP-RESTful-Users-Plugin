== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I activate the Widget =

As soon as you activate this plugin go to Widgets under Appearance, find "Network Login" and drag&drop it onto your sidebar.

= I've activated the Widget and my sidebar is different =

This is normal if you didn't use the Widgets in the first place. As soon as you add a Widget you'll be using the dynamic sidebar, therefore you need to configure it by dragging all the content you want from the left side onto the sidebar. 

== Screenshots ==

1. Server configuration view.
2. Widget.
3. Widget on sidebar.
